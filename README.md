# Taichi Elements
High-Performance Multi-Material Continuum Physics Engine (work in progress). 

The solver is being developed using Taichi, therefore it is cross-platform and supports multithreaded CPUs and massively parallel GPUs. 

The short-term plan is
 - To build a reusable multimaterial (water/elastic/snow/sand/mud) simulator
 - To integrate the simulator into Blender

## How to run (without Blender)
 - Install [Taichi](https://github.com/yuanming-hu/taichi) with pip
 - `python3 demo_2d.py` and you will see

 - `python3 demo_3d.py` and you will see a 3D simulation visualized in 2D.

## Installing Taichi for Blender
(Not sure if it is the standard approach, but it works for now.)
 - Find the Python3 executable bundled in Blender. Open a console in Blender and type in
 ```
 import sys
 print(sys.exec_prefix)
 ```
  The output looks like `/XXX/blender-2.81a-linux-glibc217-x86_64/2.81`, which means python3 is located at `/XXX/blender-2.81a-linux-glibc217-x86_64/2.81/python/bin/python3.7`
 - Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) using that Python executable
 - Install Taichi: `./python3.7m -m pip install --upgrade taichi-nightly` (Note: as of April 12 2020, Taichi version is `v0.5.11`. Please use the latest version.)

## Installing taichi_elements (experimental) for Blender
 - Set the environment variable `BLENDER_USER_ADDON_PATH`, e.g. `/home/XXX/.config/blender/2.81/scripts/addons`
 - Execute `python3 install_blender_addo.py` to install the addon
   - If you are doing development and wish to **k**eep refreshing the installed addon, add argument `-k`.
 - Restart Blender to reload the addon
